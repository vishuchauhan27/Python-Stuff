🔐 CUPP - Common User Passwords Profiler

About CUPP
In cybersecurity, one of the most common ways we secure accounts is through usernames and passwords. If both the username and password match what's stored in a secure database, the user is granted access. However, weak passwords can make this process vulnerable to attacks.

🛠️ What is a Weak Password?
A weak password is one that can be guessed easily or cracked by automated tools. Examples include:

Short passwords (like "1234" or "abcd")
Only using alphanumeric characters (just letters and numbers)
Common, guessable words (like "password," "love," or "money")
Personal information (birthdays, names of pets, favorite words, etc.)
💡 Why CUPP?
That's where CUPP (Common User Passwords Profiler) comes in. CUPP is designed to help cybersecurity professionals in legal penetration tests and forensic investigations by building a list of passwords based on user information. CUPP can profile a user to guess what passwords they might choose, making it a powerful tool in evaluating password security.

🕵️‍♂️ CUPP is valuable for:

Penetration Testing: Simulating cyberattacks to find weaknesses
Digital Forensics: Investigating cybercrimes by trying potential passwords
In short, CUPP helps highlight weak passwords by using common user habits, making it a critical tool for improving security and preventing unauthorized access.
